	<h1>Print all even numbers from 0 â€“ 10</h1>
	<p>
		Try to make the solution to this problem as efficiently as possible.
		Consider using loops that would allow you to type the fewest
		characters/commands. While you could simply print the even numbers, get
		creative and see how you could output them in a way that would work up to
		10 or even up to 10,000 with little extra effort.
